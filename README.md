# Decentralized AI for an Open Future

## TL; DR
This initiative aims to advocate a possibility to create **`a decentralized AI ecosystem`** leveraging blockchain technology to ensure **transparency, data security, and equal access to AI benefits for everyone**. By promoting open-source, inclusive, and community-driven innovation, we aspire to address the limitations of centralized AI systems and accelerate AI's positive societal impact, fostering a sustainable and a **`real open AI future`** for all human beings around the world.

As Large Language Models (LLMs) advance and exhibit increasingly emerge capabilities, we are witnessing the dawn of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This transformative technology holds the potential to revolutionize diverse aspects of our lives, reshaping industries and societal structures.
However, the current centralized AI model raises concerns about data privacy, ownership, and accessibility.   
***In order to harness the true power of AI and ensure that its benefits reach everyone, it is crucial to shift towards a decentralized, transparent, and open-sourced approach.***. 

Diverging from traditional AI models, training sophisticated large language models (LLMs) demands immense computational resources and high quality datasets. As a result, such models are predominantly owned and controlled by large tech companies which possess extensive computational power and large amount of user data to support the model training.  

Despite the endeavor of AI researchers, the inherent limitations of centralized AI products can hinder the full potential of AI development and pose considerable risks to human society.

### RISK 1: Private Data Safety

- One of the major concern is the safety of private data. Since the large language model accept raw text data as input, the user's information is entirely exposed to the service provider. During interactions with language models, users may intentionally or unintentionally disclose sensitive or confidential information, leading to potential privacy breaches. Additionally, as the conversation data could be used as training data for the language model, there exists a risk that users' private information may be "remembered" and inadvertently revealed to future users, compounding the privacy concerns.

### RISK 2: Monopoly leads to **Inequality**

- We firmly believe that powerful AI tools ought to be accessible and shared among all human individuals. However, the monopolistic control of AI models by private companies presents a significant barrier, hindering the potential for equitable distribution that introduce a substantial risk of exacerbating existing inequalities, further widening the gap between those who control AI and those who do not.

### RISK 3: Significant Resource Waste

- Recently, Pioneered by OpenAI and showcasing their cutting-edge AI models (ChatGPT & GPT-4), numerous global technology giants (e.g. Google, Amazon, Alibaba, Baidu) have followed to launch and train their own language models to push the boundaries of generative AI model to reach AGI. This competitive race, however, leads to significant resource waste. As tech companies compete with each other for market share by developing their own unique language models, the ensuing rivalry leads to a duplication of human efforts and an inefficient allocation of computational resources.

Addressing these challenges calls for an urgent paradigm shift towards decentralized AI, as it provides a more equitable, secure, and efficient solution for the future of AI development. By leveraging decentralization, we can empower individuals and organizations to retain control over their data, reduce monopolistic control, and promote more sustainable AI model training powered by computational resources and data all over the world.

As we embark on this journey towards a decentralized AI future, we acknowledge that there is still much to be explored and developed. The solution is not just about the technology itself but also the values and principles that underpin it. We must create a culture of collaboration, transparency, and open-source innovation, where everyone can contribute their unique perspective and expertise towards the common goal of advancing AI for the benefit of society.

We are still exploring the potential solution and viable algorithm to solve those problem, if you have the same vision and goal like us, do not hesitate to reach out to me.

If you share our vision and goal for a decentralized AI future, we invite you to join us on this mission. Whether you are a developer, researcher, entrepreneur, or simply an enthusiast, your contribution can make a significant difference in shaping the future of AI. We believe that by working together, we can create a more equitable, secure, and sustainable AI ecosystem that empowers individuals and organizations worldwide.

If you are passionate about this cause, do not hesitate to reach out to me.
